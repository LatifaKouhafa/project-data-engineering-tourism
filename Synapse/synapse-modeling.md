# Data Modeling – Azure Synapse Analytics

This layer represents the analytical modeling phase of the data platform.
Azure Synapse Analytics is used to expose curated datasets stored in the Gold layer for large-scale SQL analytics and reporting.

---

## Purpose
The objective of this modeling layer is to:
- Provide structured access to analytics-ready data
- Enable fast and scalable SQL queries
- Serve as a semantic layer for reporting and dashboards

---

## Data Source
- Source: Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2
- Layer: **Gold**
- Format: Delta Lake

The Gold layer contains cleaned, enriched and consolidated datasets generated by Apache Spark transformations on Azure Databricks.

---

## Modeling Approach
- A dedicated database is created in **Azure Synapse Analytics**
- SQL views are defined on top of the Gold datasets
- Views represent analytical entities such as:
  - Airbnb listings (2023)
  - Airbnb listings (2024)
  - Booking hotel data

This approach avoids data duplication and ensures data consistency.

---

## Query Engine
- SQL Pools (serverless) are used
- Queries are executed directly on data stored in the Data Lake
- Optimized for analytical workloads and BI consumption

---

## Power BI Integration
Power BI connects directly to Azure Synapse Analytics and consumes the SQL views
defined in this layer.

The dashboards provide insights such as:
- Price distribution across Paris neighborhoods
- Comparison between Airbnb and hotel offerings
- Relationship between ratings and pricing
- Identification of high-demand areas
